# Sanzo Wada's Color Combinations in Sketch

Between 1933 and 1934, Japanese artist [Sanzo Wada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanzo_Wada) published 6-volumes of color studies, documenting over a thousand color combinations. 
**A Dictionary of Color Combinations** is a book of sample color combinations based on his work.

The book provides sample color combinations for art students and professionals to use. It has been credited with being the first book to catalog color schemes in such a manner and has been compared to modern graphic design resources.

[HexPot](https://hexpot.com/) put together all 348 color combinations converted from CMYK to HEX in a Sketch file. It is a great copilot for the original book, which we highly recommend to have in your library.
